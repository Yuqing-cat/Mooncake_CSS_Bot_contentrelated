How do I perform data backup?,"The Azure backup provides two types of copies: Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) and Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS). Locally Redundant Storage copies the data in the matching data center of the same region three times (creating three data copies). Geo-Redundant Storage copies the data to the secondary region several kilometers from the primary location of the source data. In order to prevent temporary storage unavailability arising from a disaster in one region, we recommend that customers copy data by way of reading and accessing Read-access Redundant Storage (RA-GRS). This way, in case of unavailability of the storage account of the primary region, the data can be accessed from the secondary region.

What should I pay attention to when running a business application with a virtual machine?,"Azure will regularly update the environment of the host to ensure that all the operating applications and virtual machines in the platform are always in a secure environment. This updating process may restart your virtual machines. Restarting of the virtual machine will cause the operating applications in the virtual machine to go offline.

The data may be lost when the virtual machine is migrated. Some reasons for virtual machine migration are as follows:

In order to guarantee high availability of the applications/services hosted in the Azure Virtual Machine, we recommend:

1. Using multiple virtual machines during concentration of availability set.

2. Making all components (front-end interface/application logic/data storage and so on) of applications be of a high-availability structure, and make each component be deployed in multiple Virtual Machines with availability, where each Virtual Machine involved in the applications deployment going offline shall not cause the entire system to go offline.

3. After the business-critical applications are deployed to the Azure Virtual Machines, the application is thoroughly tested for the potential impact of virtual machine restarts.

Is there anything to note about using virtual machines to store application data?,"Azure Virtual Machine disk contains a temporary disk, the D: disk (Windows) or /dev/sdb1 (Linux). They only provide temporary storage, so there is a risk of data loss, and the data cannot be completely recovered under some conditions. It is recommended that the disk not be used to store data long term. The user must bear the risk of data resulting from this. Loss of temporary disk data usually occurs when virtual machines are migrated to different host machines. The reasons for virtual machine migration include: adjustment of virtual machine size, updating the host machine, or a failure in host machine hardware. The time of virtual machine migrating cannot be predicted, and it may occur when the user does not conduct any operation. Therefore, we recommend that the disk not be used to store data long term.

How do I add the virtual machine to the virtual network? What is the difference between the virtual machine network adding the virtual machine and the network not building the virtual machine? And how do I put an existing virtual machine into a new virtual network? ,"First, create a virtual network, then select the previously-created virtual network when creating the virtual machine, and add the virtual machine to the virtual network. For specific steps, please refer to <a href=""//docs.azure.cn/virtual-network/virtual-network-get-started-vnet-subnet"">How to Add the Virtual Machines to the Virtual Network</a>.

After the virtual machine is put into the Virtual Network, it’s ensured that the virtual machines can communicate with each other via internal networks, and the Premium functions, for instance P2S S2S VPN, can be configured.

If a virtual machine is not added to the virtual network during construction, it cannot be added to a virtual network later. Currently, this kind of virtual machine only can be deleted (saving the disk for storing data), and a new virtual machine will be established by using the saved data disk, and choose to join an existing virtual network when creating this virtual machine.",Implementation and Maintenance,https://www.azure.cn/en-us/support/faq#q-4-14

 What is the availability set? And how do I apply the availability set to increase the availability of applications? ,"The availability set is a kind of logical grouping function.

Azure can ensure that the VM deployed in the availability set can operate across multiple physical servers, computer racks, storage units and network switches. In case of failure of the hardware or Azure software, the VM and application will be updated, thus only part of the VM will be affected and the whole application can maintain operations for the customer.

How about the security of the Azure Storage service?,"The Azure Storage service will allocate two access keys to the user: the primary and secondary access keys. This access key is a character string with 256 bytes, and the user can use it to verify every data access request for Azure Storage services.

Two access keys have the same function of being able to access data. The setting of two access keys is to help the user switch access keys. For instance, usually, the user will use the primary access key, and if the primary access key is revealed, the user can make the primary access key invalid in the shortest time (a new primary access key will be generated) and then switch over to the secondary access key. Meanwhile, the user does not have to alter the code, and just needs to alter the service configuration file, and there is also no downtime for simultaneously updating the service configuration file. Moreover, another effective way is that the application code can use the primary access key to access data, and if verification fails, the code will automatically use the secondary access key. In this way, there will be no downtime when the user changers switches access keys.

In order to further increase flexibility of Access Control for Blob data, another data Access Control method is provided by the Azure Data Storage service, called Shared Access Signature. Management personnel can apply the Shared Access Signature to generate a temporary data access request for other users, and the temporary data access request covers effective digital signatures, and can thus pass the data verification. It also includes information about which information users can access and the operation limits and so on. At the same time, it will be effective only during the appointed time. In this way, the administrator can not only allow other users to access data, but also do so without leaking the access key.",Implementation and Maintenance,https://www.azure.cn/en-us/support/faq#q-4-19
